# TF Like

This repository contains examples of usage [Like](https://github.com/beysed/like) as meta language for create [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) files

In short 'Like' files generate Terraform files for further processing by Terraform.

The main goal that the Like files match shorter than Terraform's and this is only example how Like can be used

You can judge by example of [setup local registry](https://github.com/beysed/tf-like/tree/main/k8s_registry) using Like
