# TF Like

This repository contains examples of usage [Like](https://github.com/beysed/like) as meta language for create (Terraform)(https://www.terraform.io/) files

In short 'like' files generate Terraform files for further processing by Terraform. The main goal that the Like files match shorter than Terraform's

You can judge by example of [setup local registry](https://github.com/beysed/tf-like/tree/main/k8s_registry) using Like
